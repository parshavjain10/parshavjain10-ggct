                                                Engineering mathematics (also called Mathematical Engineering) is a branch of applied mathematics concerning mathematical methods and techniques that are typically used in engineering and industry. Along with fields like engineering physics and engineering geology (both of which may belong in the wider category engineering science), engineering mathematics is an interdisciplinary subject motivated by engineers' needs both for practical, theoretical and other considerations outwith their specialization, and to deal with constraints to be effective in their work.

                                                Engineering mathematics at tertiary level typically consists of mathematical methods and models courses, and books on the topic are extremely popular.In the English-speaking world, "Engineering mathematics" is the name of several bestselling university textbooks on the subject.

                                                The vision is to provide an education that profoundly transforms lives, society, and the world. Within the engineering, we execute that vision by providing our students with a unique combination of personal faculty member attention and opportunities to do rigorous project-based and laboratory-based mathematics and science. It is our goal that our students graduate ready to move successfully to the next stage of their education or directly into their careers.

This means that we provide our students with every opportunity to get into the laboratory and operate as independently as possible.
